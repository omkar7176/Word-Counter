# Word-Counter

## Overview
The **Word Counter** project is a Python-based program that counts the number of words in a given sentence or paragraph. This project was developed as part of a Python programming internship to strengthen understanding and application of core Python concepts such as input handling, string manipulation, function creation, and error handling.

## Features
**1. User Input**: The program prompts the user to enter a sentence or paragraph.
**2. Word Count Logic**: A function is implemented to count the number of words in the user input.
**3. Error Handling**: Accounts for empty inputs and displays an appropriate message.
**4. User-Friendly Interface**: Provides clear and concise prompts for input and output display.
**5. Code Comments**: The code is fully documented with comments explaining key parts of the logic.

## Project Objectives
**Learn how to handle user input in Python.**
**Explore string manipulation techniques to efficiently process text.**
**Practice function creation for modular programming.**
**Implement basic control flow for structured logic.**
**Provide a clear output displaying the word count.**

## Requirements
**Python 3.x**

## How to Run the Project
**1. Clone the repository**:
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/word-counter.git

**2. Navigate to the project directory**:
    cd word-counter

**3. Run the Python script**:
    python word_counter.py

## Usage
1. The program will prompt you to enter a sentence or paragraph.
2. After inputting the text, press Enter.
3. The program will output the total number of words in the text.

## Example
```plaintext
Enter a sentence or paragraph:
This is a test sentence.
